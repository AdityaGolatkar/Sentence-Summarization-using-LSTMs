# Sentence-Summarization-using-LSTMs

Codes for sentence summarization using LSTMs. We formulated sentence summarization as a binary classification problem.
Each word is either included in the summary or not. Our method performed marginally better than the benchmark (https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43852.pdf). Results can be found in the report.
